## Lance Stark — Product/Market & Onboarding Vibe
**Spoken (≈30s)**  
“Lance, I’m building FinSight—an offline-friendly finance app focused on clarity for busy, neurodivergent adults. I’d like you as an advisory voice on onboarding and ‘will real people stick with this?’ usability. Ask: a 30–45-minute review once a month of a tiny demo and a one-question decision. Strictly professional; easy opt-out.”

**Text/DM**  
“FinSight advisory ask: monthly 30–45m to sanity-check onboarding/positioning. One demo, one decision. Professional only; zero personal overlap. Interested?”

## Dustin Waters — DevSecOps Integrity & Scope Control
**Spoken (≈30s)**  
“Dustin, I need your DoD-grade discipline as an advisory DevSecOps integrity lead. Ask: bi-weekly 25 minutes to review pipeline changes, IAM/secret scopes, and call out scope creep before it bites. Strictly professional channels, clear agendas, and you have veto on unsafe moves.”

**Text/DM**  
“Advisory role: DevSecOps integrity. Bi-weekly 25m to review pipeline/IAM and flag scope creep. Professional boundaries, clear agendas. Down to help?”

## Anna Smith — Engineering Quality & Release Governance
**Spoken (≈30s)**  
“Anna, I’m shipping FinSight with a stability-first train. I want you as an advisory quality gate: smallest shippable slice, DoD sanity, and ADR feedback. Ask: 45 minutes monthly, plus the occasional PR/ADR glance. Strictly business; time-boxed; say no anytime.”

**Text/DM**  
“Quality gate advisory: 45m/month to sanity-check ADRs/DoD and keep releases tight. Business-only; time-boxed. Open to it?”

## Jason Owen — Partnerships & Intros (post-demo)
**Spoken (≈30s)**  
“Jason, once my demo is crisp, I’d value you as an advisory connector. Ask: when ready, 2–3 intros to relevant folks and 15 minutes of pitch feedback. No fundraising pitch until you say it’s ready. Clean, professional engagement; easy opt-out.”

**Text/DM**  
“When the FinSight demo is tight, could you spare 15m for pitch feedback + 2–3 intros? Strictly professional; zero pressure. OK to ping you then?”

## Jeremy Dalton — Integrations Architecture & Cadence
**Spoken (≈30s)**  
“Jeremy, FinSight’s spine is ingestion, rules, and sync. I want you as an advisory integrations architect to stress-test semantics and cadence. Ask: 45-minute design review monthly, focused on failure modes and reliability. Professional only, time-boxed.”

**Text/DM**  
“Advisory ask: 45m/month to review ingestion/sync design for failure modes and cadence. Purely professional, focused, optional. Interested?”

## Rikell Hammer — Onboarding Experience & Declutter
**Spoken (≈30s)**  
“Rikell, I need your event-ops eye for first-run clarity. Role: advisory onboarding & declutter. Ask: 20 minutes every other week to pick the least-chaotic screen and trim copy. Professional lane only—clean feedback in, cleaner UI out.”

**Text/DM**  
“Onboarding/declutter advisory: 20m every other week to pick the least-chaotic screen and cut noise. Professional lane only. Game?”

## Heather Lloyd — Usability Litmus (“60-Second Success”)
**Spoken (≈30s)**  
“Heather, you’re my reality check. Role: beta usability lead. Ask: when I send a tiny feature, try it for 60 seconds and tell me if it’s obvious—or not. If it’s hard, we change it. No pressure; stop anytime.”

**Text/DM**  
“Beta ask: 60-second tryouts of tiny features; tell me if it’s obvious or awful. Straightforward, professional, stop anytime. In?”

## Amanda Snyder — Accessibility & Real-Life Constraints
**Spoken (≈30s)**  
“Amanda, I want FinSight to work under real-life constraints. Role: beta for friction/accessibility. Ask: 10–15-minute scenarios—import, tag, summary—and honest ‘keep or kill’ feedback. Professional boundary; opt-in per sprint.”

**Text/DM**  
“Beta role: 10–15m flows (import/tag/summary) to test speed and accessibility. Professional boundary; opt-in per sprint. Interested?”

## Ground Rules (say once to everyone)
- Professional engagement only—clear agendas, recorded decisions, time-boxed sessions.  
- You owe me nothing; say no anytime.  
- Compensation/profit-share is a future, explicit agreement—no implied commitments here.
