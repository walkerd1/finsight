# Code of Conduct

**Short version:** Be respectful. Keep PRs focused. Violations = removal.

## Purpose
Create a professional, inclusive space to build FinSight quickly and safely.

## Scope
This applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues/PRs/discussions, chat, meetings, and any community events—online or offline.

## Expected Behavior
- Be respectful, direct, and kind in all interactions.
- Keep PRs **small, focused, and reviewable**; respond to feedback in good faith.
- Assume positive intent; disagree with ideas, not people.
- Protect user privacy and security; report vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.
- Doxxing or sharing private information without consent.
- Sexualized language or imagery in any project context.
- Threats, intimidation, or sustained disruption.
- Discriminatory jokes or slurs.
- Spam, self-promotion unrelated to the work.
- Knowingly introducing insecure code or bypassing safety checks.

## PR & Review Etiquette
- One vertical slice per PR with tests/docs/flags as needed.
- No drive-by approvals; leave actionable comments.
- Avoid “design by PR comment”—open an issue for big changes.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- Email the maintainers at **conduct@finsight.dev** (or open a private GitHub discussion if enabled).
- Urgent safety/security concerns may be escalated directly to a maintainer via DM.

Reports will be reviewed promptly and kept as confidential as the circumstances allow.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including:
- Warning, temporary mute/suspension, or permanent removal from the project.
- Reverting/locking PRs, deleting content that violates this policy.
- Bans from repos/org participation.

Decisions are final. Re-admission requires explicit maintainer approval.

## Attribution
Inspired by the spirit of the Contributor Covenant v2.1, adapted for a fast-moving, professional engineering project.
